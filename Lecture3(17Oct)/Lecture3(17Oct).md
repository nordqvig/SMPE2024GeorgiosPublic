## Pointing Analysis:
Started working on pointing analysis project. Made copy of the gitlab repo.

[Experiment](https://ergo.human.cornell.edu/FittsLaw/FittsLaw.html] completed) completed with parameters:

| Parameter  | Value(s)    |
|------------|-------------|
| Width      | 16,32,64    |
| Amplitudes | 128,256,512 |
| Trials     | 5           |

Data from website saved in .csv files in MYm2r_pointingxp/MYdata

Looking into how to plot my data for the analysis. 


I am getting results differen from those presented on the webiste. The differences are in the following table:


| Value     | My result | Cornell website result |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| R2        | 0.8922    | 0.913.                 |
| Intercept | 266.40    | 254.848                |
| Slope     | 107.30    | 107.280                |




My R2 value is 0.8922 whereas they present R2_Cornell = 0.913.
